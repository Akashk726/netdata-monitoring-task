# Netdata Monitoring Task

This is my submission for Task 7: Monitor System Resources Using Netdata.

## What I Did
1. Installed Docker on Ubuntu.
2. Ran Netdata using the Docker command in \`run_netdata.sh\`.
3. Opened the dashboard at \`http://localhost:19999\` to see CPU, memory, and other metrics.
4. Checked collectors (like \`cgroups.plugin\` for Docker).
5. Looked at alerts (e.g., CPU usage warnings).
6. Viewed logs in \`/var/log/netdata/error.log\`.
7. Took a screenshot of the dashboard.

## Files
- \`run_netdata.sh\`: The command to start Netdata.
- \`screenshots/netdata_dashboard.png\`: Screenshot of the dashboard.
- This README: Explains my work.

## Results
Netdata showed live system metrics, and I learned how to monitor servers using its dashboard.

## Notes
- Run \`run_netdata.sh\` with Docker installed.
- View the dashboard at \`http://localhost:19999\`.
- The screenshot will be added after capturing.
